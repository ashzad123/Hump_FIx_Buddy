        <h1>Back Hump Correction Guide</h1>
        <p>The back hump, also known as kyphosis, is a condition where the spine curves forward, leading to a hunched posture. Regular exercises can help correct this condition, and YWTL poses are particularly effective in strengthening the back and improving posture.</p>

        <h2>YWTL Poses</h2>
        <p>The YWTL poses are designed to target the muscles that support your posture. Hereâ€™s how each pose helps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Y-Pose:</strong> This pose targets the upper back and shoulders, helping to improve flexibility and alignment.</li>
            <li><strong>W-Pose:</strong> Focuses on the middle back muscles, encouraging the scapula to retract and open the chest.</li>
            <li><strong>T-Pose:</strong> Strengthens the lower trapezius and rhomboids, which play a crucial role in maintaining an upright posture.</li>
            <li><strong>L-Pose:</strong> Targets the lower back and lumbar region, helping to stabilize the spine and reduce the curvature.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By performing these poses regularly, you can gradually correct your posture and alleviate the symptoms of a back hump.</p>
